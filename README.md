# About Meghana Thota

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m Meghana Thota, an AI Engineer at LVC Solutions, where I build autonomous AI agents that power a next-generation scheduling chatbot â€” capable of understanding, reasoning, and acting independently.

One of my recent builds is the Patient Profile Agent, which fetches structured patient data in JSON format from EHR systems using only a patient ID. Another, the Dictation Agent, converts long medical conversations into concise, structured summaries using OpenAI Whisper-Large, GPT-4o, and LLaMA models.

To support these systems, I design Kafka-based data pipelines (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers) and leverage AWS (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, SageMaker, Bedrock) for scalable orchestration and deployment. I also build CI/CD pipelines for seamless model updates and explore frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, RAG, and multi-agent coordination patterns (MCP) to create intelligent, self-collaborating AI ecosystems.

In parallel, I developed an end-to-end Retail Data Analytics Pipeline â€” a serverless AWS project using S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, transforming raw retail sales data into actionable dashboards through fully automated ETL workflows.

Beyond engineering, I love writing about AI and ML on Medium, learning new languages (currently Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸), and collaborating on deep learning projects or research papers.

Iâ€™m actively seeking full-time roles such as AI Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Scientist, Prompt Engineer, or Deep Learning Engineer, and open to collaborations in applied AI research.
